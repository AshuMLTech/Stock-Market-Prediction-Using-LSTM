# 📈 Stock Market Prediction using LSTM

This project demonstrates how Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks can be used for time-series forecasting of stock market prices. By leveraging historical stock data, the LSTM model attempts to predict future price trends for better investment insights.

## 🧾 About the Project

Forecasting stock prices is one of the most challenging problems in finance. This project uses a deep learning approach with LSTM (a variant of Recurrent Neural Networks) to learn long-term dependencies in time-series data.

The workflow includes:
- Downloading historical stock price data using `yfinance`
- Data preprocessing and moving average smoothing
- LSTM model construction and training
- Evaluation of predictions using MAE, MSE, RMSE
- Visualization of predicted vs. actual values

## 🧪 Methodology

* The dataset consists of historical stock prices for a selected ticker (e.g., AAPL).
* Features such as Moving Averages are computed.
* The data is scaled and reshaped to match the input requirements of LSTM layers.
* A Keras LSTM model is trained on the sequence data.
* The model's performance is evaluated using:

  * **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
  * **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
  * **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**

---

## 📊 Results

* Visual graphs of predictions vs actual values
* Evaluation metrics saved in `results/metrics.txt`
* Insight into the predictability of the chosen stock using LSTM

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

* LSTM performance depends heavily on hyperparameter tuning
* Predictions are purely based on historical prices; no external indicators (e.g., news, volume) are considered
* Not intended for real-world financial decision-making
